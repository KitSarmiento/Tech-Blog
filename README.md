# Tech-Blog
This weekâ€™s project is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to Wordpress for this week's challenge. The site will let developers publish blog posts and comment on others' posts. Create the app from scratch and deploy it on Heroku. Use Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.
